# R integration
There is a chance to run shell commands via engines like `bash` from inside an R markdown `.Rmd` document. `knitr` [supports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/eng-bash.html#eng-bash) `bash` language command chunks on Unix and macOS. It is not impossible for Windows users to [run Shell scripts](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/?version=1.2.5042&mode=desktop#language-engines), but you will have to install additional software (such as Cygwin or the Linux Subsystem).

Currently, `bash is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`
